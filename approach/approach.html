  <h5 class="hidden-xs"><strong>APPROACH</strong></h5>
  <div>
    <p>We go to great lengths to ensure that the IT services we deliver not only surpass your expectations, but ours too. Quality is a way of life for us, and covers all our processes, interfaces and outputs, in management, core and support process.</p>
    <p>The quality systems at Hermes Technologies match the best in the world. We benchmark ourselves against international quality standards, like ISO 9000, CMM and recently, the Malcolm Baldrige framework. In addition, we use world-class techniques like the Six Sigma Cross Functional Process Mapping (CFPM) methodologies (from Motorola University) to facilitate process improvement. However, Hermes technologies Quality is more than a mere adherence to these benchmarks, but a proactive quest for process improvement, beyond conventional limits.</p>
    <p>A number of quality tracking methodologies, tools, and processes are put in place to ensure superior quality products and service to Hermes clients - in each engagement and also across engagements, at the relationship level. These quality tracking methodologies are applied in four key areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Relationship Management : We work with every client as our only client.</li>
      <li>Software and Service Quality: We deliver the work as it is the only chance to deliver</li>
      <li>Operations</li>
      <li>Resourcing</li>
      <li>Project Management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The outsourcing is the mantra of the IT industry now a days. Today, offshore global outsourcing has gained widespread acceptance as a crucial aspect of business strategy. Enabled by the availability of highly-educated, technically-skilled and low-cost talent in India and other emerging economies, the outsourcing has achieved broad acceptance through its ability to deliver lower costs, higher quality, and productivity.</p>
    <p>Hermes is well ahead in adopting and delivering to this need by simply following the philosophy of
      <ul>
        <li>breaking pieces of work into logical components and</li>
        <li>distributing these components geo-locationally, to perform them where it creates the maximum value.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Onsite:</strong>
      <p>Hermes Technologies has evolved a customer-driven approach in providing the right application customized to the user's requirements.
         The conventional and proven method of development for new software and Customization at the premises of the client . This method of development facilitates higher user interaction.</p>
      <p>In the On-Site Development scenario, Clients will have to set up development and production environment.
T        his could work out to be expensive, since the resources will be dedicated for the entire duration of the project and also On-site cost would be higher, since it also includes transportation and settling costs.</p>
      </p>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Offsite:</strong>
        <p>Hermes Technologies has evolved a customer-driven approach in providing the right application customized to the user's requirements.
           The development takes place at Hermes's development centers in US. Though user interaction can be limited, this is more economical than onsite option, since it facilitates need-based allocation of resources to the project (resource loading will vary based on the requirement of each stage of the project). Client need not setup development environment
        </p>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Offshore:</strong>
      <p>Hermes's Offshore Development Center will act as a perfect extension of Client's own facilities.
         Hermes's Projects are delivered by a global team with 15 to 20 percent of the team members located onsite at the client location and the rest of the team is located at our offshore development centers in India. The onsite team interacts daily with the customer to define requirements, review prototypes and manage scope changes. Hermes's Onsite Project Lead/Team lead co-ordinates with Hermes's Offshore development team. Onsite and offshore teams collaborate on common systems, linked by our global network. The offshore team ensures quality execution at a low cost, as well as access to our technology competency centers.
